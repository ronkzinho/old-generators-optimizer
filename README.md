So, I did this based on [FSGOptimizerSeedBank](https://github.com/Specnr/FSGOptimizedSeedBank/) and it runs the generator you want locally, downloading it from a media fire directory that I created, with all the generators already ready to go, all the generators from the media fire is on my repl profile, wich I just changed some things for it to work with the hotkey.

It is required to have python3 and wsl, here's how to install: [FSGOptimizerSeedBank](https://github.com/Specnr/FSGOptimizedSeedBank/blob/main/README.md)

Change the settings.json file with the generator you want(from the supported generators) to use and then just open the hotkey file, and with minecraft open, press Y to test it.

And also don't forget to change the minecraft folder(on the hotkey script) with where your minrcraft saves are.

# Supported generators #:

```
fsg-power-village-plusplus
filteredseed
fsg-power-village-minus-minus
```
